# D3.js-Dynamic-Bar-chart

This project demonstrates how to create a dynamic bar chart using D3.js. The bar chart represents a dataset through proportional bar lengths and includes interactive elements such as transitions and hover effects.

## Features

- **Dynamic SVG Container**: Initializes an SVG container with specified dimensions.
- **Linear Scale**: Configures a linear scale for the x-axis to map dataset values proportionally.
- **Bar Rendering**: Renders bars with widths set by the scaled data values and includes a <text> label for each bar.
- **Transitions**: Adds animation to the bars as they load.
- **Hover Effects**: Implements interactive hover effects to highlight bars.
